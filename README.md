## Crypcoin: Real-Time Crypto Market Data Streaming

Crypcoin is a dynamic web application designed to provide users with real-time
cryptocurrency market data using Binance's WebSocket API. Leveraging the power
of Lightweight Charts, the platform delivers seamless and interactive
visualizations of live price movements, order book updates, and trade history.
Built for traders and crypto enthusiasts, Crypcoin offers a responsive and
intuitive interface to monitor market trends and make informed decisions. This
project showcases my expertise in real-time data streaming, front-end
development, and financial data visualization.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates
as you edit the file.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)
to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font
family for Vercel.
